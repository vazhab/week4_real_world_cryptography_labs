1. TLS Handshake Explanation:
   The TLS handshake starts with a Client Hello, where the client proposes supported TLS versions and cipher suites. The server replies with a Server Hello, selects parameters, and sends its digital certificate. After a key exchange, both parties derive a shared secret used to encrypt further communication.

2. MITM Protection:
   TLS protects against Man-in-the-Middle attacks using digital certificates and certificate authorities. If a certificate is invalid, expired, or tampered with, the browser warns the user and terminates the connection.

3. TLS in Websites:
   Websites use HTTPS, which relies on TLS to encrypt communication between users and servers. This ensures that login credentials, payment information, and other sensitive data remain private and secure from interception or modification.
