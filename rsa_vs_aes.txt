RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm used mainly for secure key exchange and digital signatures. It is slower and more resource-intensive, which makes it unsuitable for encrypting large data files.

AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm optimized for speed and efficiency when encrypting large files. It requires both parties to securely share a secret key, unlike RSA which uses key pairs.

In practice, RSA is often used to securely transmit an AES key, and the actual data is encrypted with AESâ€”this combines the strengths of both algorithms.
